OVERCOMING ISSUES
-Schedules & Communications

To share with you a few issues we had over this semester, one reocurring problem that happend the most was our availability during the week. Aside from the last 15 minutes of class, we had different schedules which can be challenging in a group of 7 members. What ended up happening because of our different scheudles, was to work with whoever was available and inform the absent members what happened and what's the next step. 

The main tool of communication was through e-mail, and occasionally we'd have a meeting online over the weekend to not only check up on everyone but also to see how or who can complete the remaining tasks.

-Skills & Teamwork

Another problem that happened a lot with our group was that we assumed our skills were enough to complete certain tasks including annotations, UML, JSP, and also learning OpenMRS. A few times there were tasks that were reassigned to someone else because we assumed that we'd be able to complete it, but we couldn't complete it in time. Around the halfway point of the semester we were more aware of our work habits, and our teamwork improved. We were able to get tasks done ahead of time, and it became more consistent. 

By the last two months each member had the appropriate amount of work for them and everyone's difference in skills were effective in completing the tasks.
